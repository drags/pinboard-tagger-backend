# Pinboard-Tagger-Backend

A quick backend shim for [pinboard-tagger](https://github.com/drags/pinboard-tagger) to make use of the [golang pinboard library](https://github.com/drags/pinboard). While the entire project could have been implemented within ReactJS itself the Pinboard library was initially built (to be used for a desktop GUI application) before deciding to expose it as a web app.

This code has no license or warranty and is purely a personal project. Feel free to use some or all of it, at your own peril.
